 MvButton is a Meveo button component (based on lit-element) that renders a button.

## Features
* Allows custom elements to be used in button labels
* Includes several button styles
* Written in vanilla javascript


## Quick Start

To experiment with the MvButton component.

1. Clone this repo.
2. Serve the project from the root directory with some http server (best served with meveo itself)
3. Sample button usage is included in the `demo.js`

4 types of buttons are included:
```
default, circle, rounded, and outline
```

4 button styles are included:
```
success, error, info, and cancel
```
**Note:** At this time, circle button only has one included style.

When the button is clicked, the event `button-clicked` is dispatched.
